# LibraryProject
This project is a virtual library to store books you have read or you plan to read. I am a reader and I often forget the names of the author or even sometimes the book by a particular author. So I created this project which solved my problem. With this I can keep track of what I read or what I have in my bucket list. It lets us store a few information regarding the book and also lets us select whether we have read it or not. The purpose behind this project was to get ins and outs of how local storage works and how it can be used to store data. It taught me how I can store,fetch and delete data with local storage.
